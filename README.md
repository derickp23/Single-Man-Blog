# Single-Man-Blog
My final project:

My webpage is a blog page I created to showcase my Quotes. I have a CSS effect that slides text from left to right on the page when the page is first loaded. I have 16 quotes displaying on my webpage running on a javascript loop. Above the quote sections is a button that when clicked hides the images. My page has four media queries that align the navigation bar and columns vertically depending on the size of the screen, as well as change the background color to dark blue and hides the footer. Additionally, I have javascript that generates a number when the page is refreshed. I call it the Ex generator as a fun way for people to refresh the page to see the random number. I have clickable links which take you to sections of my webpage, along with working links at the bottom of the page.
