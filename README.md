# Single-Man-Blog
My final project:

My webpage is a blog page I created to showcase Quotes that enlarge when you click them. I have links to my actual Twitter and Facebook pages along with links to sections of my webpage. When you first load my page the paragraphs come in from left to right as a CSS animation. My page has four media queries that align the navigation bar and columns vertically depending on the size of the screen as well as change the background color to dark blue and hides the sign in form. I have buttons above my quotes that can collapse when clicked on. I have a number generator that I call the Ex generator as a fun way for people to refresh the page to see the random number. I have added a sign in form at the bottom of the page that when you hit submit (after filling in the fields) it displays a pop up that shows the input information.
