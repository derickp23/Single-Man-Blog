# Single-Man-Blog
My final project
My webpage is a blog page I created to showcase Quotes that I have came up with along that you can click to enlarge. I have links to my actual Twitter and Facebook pages. When you first load my page I have a top bar that floats as an example of a CSS animation. My page has two media queries that align the navigation bar and columns vertically depending on the size of the screen.
