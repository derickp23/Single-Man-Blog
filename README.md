# Single-Man-Blog
My final project:

My webpage is a blog page I created to showcase Quotes that enlarge when you click them. I have links to my actual Twitter and Facebook pages along with links to sections of my webpage. When you first load my page I have a top bar that floats as an example of a CSS animation. My page has three media queries that align the navigation bar and columns vertically depending on the size of the screen as well as change the background color. I have buttons above my quotes that can collapse when clicked on. I have a number generator that I call the Ex generator as a fun way for people to refresh the page to see the random number. I have added a sign in form at the bottom of the page that when you hit submit (after filling in the fields) it displays a pop up that shows the input information.
